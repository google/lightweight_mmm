      used.
    media_input_shape: Input shape of the data required by the model to get
      predictions. This is needed since optimization might flatten some arrays
      and they need to be reshaped before running new predictions.
    media_gap: Media data gap between the end of training data and the start of
      the out of sample media given. Eg. if 100 weeks of data were used for
      training and prediction starts 2 months after training data finished we
      need to provide the 8 weeks missing between the training data and the
      prediction data so data transformations (adstock, carryover, ...) can take
      place correctly. Must be scaled with the media scaler that was used to scale
      the media data before training.
    target_scaler: Scaler that was used to scale the target before training.
    media_scaler: Scaler that was used to scale the media data before training.
    geo_ratio: The ratio to split channel media across geo. Should sum up to 1
      for each channel and should have shape (c, g).
    seed: Seed to use for PRNGKey during sampling. For replicability run
      this function and any other function that gets predictions with the same
